  <h2>Week 4 - Notes</h2>
  <h4>Forms</h4>
  <p>
  JavaScript can now be used to process form information instead of php<br><br>
  forms can be accessed i.e const form = document.forms[0]; or i.e const form = document.getElementsByTagname('form')[0]; or i.e const form = document.forms.search; using the name attribute similarly we could use bracket notation<br><br>
  focus event is when cursor is inside input field<br><br>
  blur is when user moves focus from form element<br><br>
  change is when user moves focus from form element and made changes<br><br>
  reset will reset all fields in the form careful when using as user can easily remove all data entered<br><br>
  form.action sets the action attribute<br><br>
submit sends content to the server<br><br> 
the submit event lister can be used to intercept before its sent to the server<br><br>
type password on an input will hide entered characters<br><br>
Javascript should not be uses to replace backend validation but to enhance user experience and cut down on requests<br><br>
using javacript you can give feedback on form immediately instead of after it is submitted<br><br>
</p>
<h4>OOP</h4>
<p>
create instance of class with new operator just like java<br><br>
you can also create class using keyword class with a similar format to java instead of constructor functions<br><br>
you can call the constructor function with out knowing it's name using .constructor<br><br>
static methods are called by the class directly rather than instances of the class<br><br>
prototypal inheritance every class has a prototype property shared by every instance of the class<br><br>
you can add methods and properties to a class after it has been created using prototype property<br><br>
if new property or method is added any instance will also inherit the property even if its already created<br><br>
Never use arrays or objects as a default value in prototypes <br><br>
getter and setter methods can also be used in js to keep properties private<br><br>
usually build in methods are non-enumerable and user defined methods are non-enumerable<br><br>
extends can be used in JS similar to Java<br><br>
adding functionality to built in objects is called monkey-patching frowned upon in JS<br><br>
you can create objects form another object that is provided as an argument<br><br>
Mixins a way of adding methods from one object to another without inheritance<br><br>
factory function is a function used to create objects<br><br>
use that = this to keep this from losing its scope in nested functions<br><br>
you can borrow methods without inheriting all properties and methods using call referencing another objects method<br><br>
prefer composition over inheritance<br><br>
module is a self contained piece of code that can be used in other projects kept in a separate file<br><br>
</p>

  <h2>Week 4 - Questions</h2>
  <p>Is there any reason to use the constructor function method to make class?<br><br>
      Is Static functions defined the same way across all programming languages?<br><br>
      
Why is prototyping useful?<br><br>
Are mixins and interfaces used for similar tasks?<br><br>
  </p>
