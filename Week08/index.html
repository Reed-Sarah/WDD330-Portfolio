<h1>WDD 330 - Portfolio</h1>
<h2>Week 8 - Notes</h2>
<h4>Transforms</h4>
<p>
  using translate will move an object without effect the flow of the document<br><br>
  Examples: transform: translate(x,y), translateX(45px), translateY(-30px)<br><br>
  don't work on inline objects use inline-block to fix<br><br>
  similar functions for scaling, providing one value is the same as the same value for <br><br>
  using on inline could cause crowding issues<br><br>
Other transforms include rotate() rotates around the origin in the direction of the sign<br><br>
Skew takes two values for x and y axis<br><br>
Origin defaults to center but can be changed<br><br>
the order of your transforms matters<br><br>
</p>
<h4>Transitions</h4>
<p>
CSS animations require less processing than JS and therefore are smoother<br><br>
transition-property defines the the CSS property that should be transitioned<br><br>
Only properties with a midpoint can be transitioned <br><br>
transition-duration sets how long the transition takes <br><br>
200ms is considered optimal <br><br>
transition-timing-function allows you to control the pace some values include ease liner ease-in ease-out <br><br>
transition-delay set a delay on the transition<br><br>
transition will shorthand all of these properties for us can be in any order but duration must be before delay<br><br>
you can have many transitions in one use csv<br><br>
</p>
<h4>Animations</h4>
<p>
animation allows for more control of intermediate states with keyframes<br><br>
to declare keyframe use @keyframe then space and name the keyframe<br><br>
keyframes use percentages to declare the state of the animation at given percentage through the animation<br><br>
animation need animation-name, animation-duration <br><br>
values use for transition timing functions can also be used for animation timing functions<br><br>
animation-iteration-count defines how many times the animation will play<br><br>
you reverse animation with animation-direction <br><br>
animation delay is same as transition animation <br><br>
there is also an animation shorthand <br><br>

</p>

<h4>Canvas</h4>
<p>
Steps to create canvas element
</P>
<ul>
<li>add canvas tags to document</li>
<li>add id to grab in js</li>
<li> set width and height in html not with css</li>
<li>grab canvas in the js from the document </li>
<li>getContext("2d")</li>
<li>set  the stroke and the fill</li>
<li>begin drawing</li>
</ul>
<p>
to draw a rectangle use fillRect and StrokeRect and defining its position from the top left corner<br><br>
instead of a color we could have used CanvasPattern or CanvasGradient<br><br>
for shapes other than rectangles you must first layout the path<br><br>
signature for arc arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, anticlockwise)<br><br>
after creating the path close path and call fill and stroke to finish shape<br><br>
you can draw img onto the canvas and manipulate them i.e change to black and white<br><br>
you can also manipulate video with canvas <br><br>
you can get around security error with try catch<br><br>
you can add text with CAnvas as well but is invisible to screen readers<br><br>
</p>
<h4>SVG</h4>
<p>
SVG keep there quality even if you blow them up <br><br>
shapes are easier to draw in svg than<br><br>
use svg tags then shape tag inside those and set various properties<br><br>
for complex shapes you can use an SVG editor<br><br>
</p>
<h4>Drag and Drop</h4>
<p>
to make draggable add draggable attribute to html element<br><br>
add event listener to draggable element <br><br>
add event listener for dragover and drop events<br><br>
</p>

<h2>Week 8 - Questions</h2>
<p>
  Is canvas widely used? It seems like a cumbersome way to draw things.<br><br>
  Is there editors for Canvas like there is for SVG?
